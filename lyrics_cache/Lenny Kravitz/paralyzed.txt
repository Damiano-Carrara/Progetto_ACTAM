[Verse]
In your face and in your eyes
I see truth beneath your lies
I have faith in all you do
Heal my pain, make all things new

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
I'm under your spell, I'm hypnotized
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
Babe, without your love, I'm paralyzed

[Verse]
You're the sun that always shines
Stare you down until I'm blind
Every day my dreams come true
I can't get enough of you

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
I'm under your spell, I'm hypnotized
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
Babe, without your love, I'm paralyzed

[Bridge]
I need your love
Baby, I need your love

[Chorus]
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
I'm under your spell, I'm hypnotized
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
Babe, without your love, I'm paralyzed

All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
I'm under your spell, I'm hypnotized
All you gotta do is keep on lovin' me
Babe, without your love, I'm paralyzed

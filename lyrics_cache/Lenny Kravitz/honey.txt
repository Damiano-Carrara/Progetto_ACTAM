[Verse 1]
My spirit starts to move when I look in your eyes
And I’m shaking, baby ‘cause your spell has got me hypnotized
My heart's beating and it won't stop
My blood's rising straight to the top
When I need you, I can't get enough oh yeah

[Chorus]
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey (Mm)
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey (Yeah)
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey

[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby, it never feels the same, it's different every time
And I'll never ever make you wait when you give me the sign
If you feel it, don't hеsitate
I am ready, I won't be latе
Babe, I need you, I can't get enough, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey (Mm)
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey (Yeah)
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey

[Verse 3]
It don't take much to turn me on
The clothes that you wear, the smell of your hair
Takes me over
Oh, the passion we brew is a love always new
It's so right
Oh babe I can't wait, I'll be jumping straight into your fire, oh
Come, let's do it into the night
I am here to make you feel right
When I need you, I can't get enough, oh yeah

[Chorus and Outro]
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
Oh yeah
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
Every day, girl
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
Oh yeah
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
I need you honey
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
Ooh-ooh
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey
Oh yeah
I need you honey
Oh, I need you honey

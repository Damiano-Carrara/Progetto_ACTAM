[Verse 1]
He broke your heart
He took your soul
You hurt inside
'Cause there's a hole
You need some time
To be alone
Then you will find
What you've always known

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the one who really loves you, baby
I've been knocking at your door

[Chorus]
As long as I'm living
I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me
I'll be there

[Verse 2]
I've seen ya cry
Into the night
I feel your pain
Can I make it right?
I realize
There's no end in sight
Yet still I wait
For you to see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the one who really loves you, baby
I can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
As long as I'm living
I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me
I'll be there

[Bridge]
You are the only one
I've ever known
That makes me feel this way
Girl, you are my own
I want to be with you
Until we're old
You've got the love you need right in front of you
Please come home

[Chorus]
As long as I'm living
I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me
I'll be there
As long as I'm living
I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing
I'll be there
Whenever you call me
I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me
I'll be there

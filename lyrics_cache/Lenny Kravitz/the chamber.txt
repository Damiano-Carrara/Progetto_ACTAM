[Verse 1]
You killed the love that was once so strong
With no regret to what you did wrong
Should I stay and fight?
Can we make this right?
You looked through me like an open door
Do I exist to you anymore?
’Cause when I'm talking to you
There's someone else that you're hearing

[Chorus]
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last

[Verse 2]
You played your game, used me like a pawn
Check mate you're done and then you were gone
Did I move too fast?
I thought we would last
Now that you're through I can feel your soul
Where there was love lies an empty hole
Cause when I make love to you
It's someone else that you're feeling

[Chorus]
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last

[Interlude]
So many nights
I've been standing at the wall
Blindfolded with cigarette
Waiting for the fall

[Chorus]
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last
I gave you all the love I had
And I almost gave you one more chance
Then you put one in the chamber
And shot my heart of glass
This time will be the last

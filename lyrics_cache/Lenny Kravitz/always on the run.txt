[Verse 1: Lenny Kravitz]
My mama said
That your life is a gift
And my mama said
There's much weight you will lift
And my mama said
Leave those bad boys alone
And my mama said
Be home before the dawn
And my mama said
You can be rich or poor
But my mama said
You can be big or small

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
But I'm always on the run
Always on the run
But I'm always on the run

[Verse 2: Lenny Kravitz]
My mama said
That it's good to be fruitful
But my mama said
Don't take more than a mouthful
And my mama said
That it's good to be natural
And my mama said
That it's good to be factual

[Chorus]
But I'm always on the run
Always on the run
But I'm always on the run

[Verse 3: Lenny Kravitz]
My mama said
Baby don't ride that crazy horse
And my mama said
You must push with much force
And my mama said
Go get all that you're after
And my mama said
That love's all that matters

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz]
But I'm always on the run
Always on the run
But I'm always on the run
But I'm always on the run
Always on the run
But I'm always on the run

[Outro: Lenny Kravitz]
Hmm, what say mama, you want it
Hmm, right now, got to hold on, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm out here on the street
There's no one left to meet
The things that were so sweet
No longer move my feet
But I keep trying
I keep on trying

[Chorus]
All that I want
Is stillness of heart
So I can start
To find my way
Out of the dark
And into your heart

[Verse 2]
I got more than I can eat
A life that can't be beat
Yet still I feel this heat
I'm feeling incomplete
What am I buying?
My soul is crying

[Chorus]
All that I want
Is stillness of heart
So I can start
To find my way
Out of the dark
And into your heart

[Bridge]
Where's the love?
What is this world we live in?
Where's the love?
We've got to keep on giving
Where's the love?
What happened to forgiving?
Anyone?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
All that I want
Is stillness of heart
So I can start
To find my way
Out of the dark
And into your heart

All that I want
Is stillness of heart
So I can start
To find my way
Out of the dark
And into your heart

All that I want
Is stillness of heart
So I can start
To find my way
Out of the dark
And into your heart

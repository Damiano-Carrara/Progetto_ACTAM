[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
All aboard, now it's time to face your fears
The conversations in your mind
You can tell me how it really makes you feel
And I will promise you it will be fine

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, get on the one (On the one)
Can you feel it, my T-K-4-2-1?
Look out, baby, drop on the one (On the one)
So much better, my T-K-4-2-1

[Verse 2]
All aboard, take it to the stratosphere
The congregation is alive
All I'm asking is for you to break the seal
So we can dance our way to the divine

[Chorus]
Hey, come on, baby, get on the one (On the one)
Can you feel it, my T-K-4-2-1?
Look out, baby, drop on the one (On the one)
So much better, my T-K-4-2-1

[Bridge]
Come on, baby (On the one)
Can you feel it? (T-K-4-2-1)
Look out, baby (On the one)
So much better (T-K-4-2-1)

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, get on the one (On the one)
Can you feel it, my T-K-4-2-1?
Look out, baby, drop on the one (On the one)
So much better, my T-K-4-2-1
Come on, baby, get on the one (On the one)
Can you feel it, my T-K-4-2-1?
Just look out, baby, drop on the one (On the one)
So much better, my T-K-4-2-1
